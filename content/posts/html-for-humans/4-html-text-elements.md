This is when things start to get fun! This article we'll talk about different text elements that can be used in HTML files.

## HTML Tags And Elements

The last article we breezed over the whole concept of the HTML Tags and Elements. That is an important concept so we'll cover that now. Take a look at the following `<title>` tag. We talked about this tag in the last article but in case you missed it, the `<title>` tag displays the title of the site in the tab header.

```html
<title>Site Title</title>
```

**Tag** - HTML Tags are the building block of websites. In the above example, the `<title>` is the **opening tag** and the `</title>` is the **closing tag**.

**Elements** - HTML Elements build on the tags. The whole example above is an **HTML Element**

## Starting Big - Headers

The first set of elements we'll talk about are the header elements. Much like in Microsoft Word, these are the largest elements of the page. There are six levels of headers. From largest to smallest, these are `h1` - `h6`. Using the template we had from the last article, type the following between the `<body> </body>` tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document Name</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is a Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is a Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is a Heading 6</h6>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the file in a browser and take a look at what they look like. You should have a similar output to below.
